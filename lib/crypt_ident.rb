  # representing the contents of the newly-added record in the Repository, and
  # `cryptid_config`, which contains the data in the CryptIdent configuration,
  # such as `success_key` and `error_key`. Any value returned from the block *is

  # variable, as well as any other side-effects (logging, etc) that are
  # appropriate.
  #
  # On failure, the block *is not* yielded to, and the method returns a Symbol
  # designating the cause of the failure. This will be one of the following:

  #   `nil` or the Guest User, it returns `:current_user_exists`;

  #   exists in the Repository, the return value is `:user_already_created`;

  #               in the created Entity/record by a `password_hash` attribute.
  # @param [String] current_user Entity representing the current Authenticated
  #               User, or the Guest User. A value of `nil` is treated as though

  #               data. A value of `nil` indicates that the default Repository

  # who Registered that User or, if not, that no compromise or other harm is
  # done.
  #
  # Typically, this is done by sending a link through email or other such medium
  # to the address previously associated with the User purportedly requesting
  # the Password Reset. `CryptIdent` *does not* automate generation or sending
  # of the email message. What it *does* provide is a method to generate a new
  # Password Reset Token to be embedded into an HTML anchor link within an email
  # that you construct.
  #
  # It also implements an expiry system, such that if the confirmation of the
  # Password Reset request is not completed within a configurable time, that the
  # token is no longer valid (and so cannot be later reused by unauthorised
  # persons).
