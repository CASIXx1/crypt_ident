  # **IMPORTANT:** Even though we follow time-honoured convention
  # here and call the variable yielded by the `CryptIdent.configure_crypt_ident`
  # block `config`, settings *are not* being stored in an *instance variable*
  # called `@config`. That is *too likely* to conflict with something Important;
  # remember, we're a module, not a class, and good table manners are *also*
  # Important.
  #
  # This is normally run from the `controller.prepare` block inside your app's
  # `apps/<app name>/application.rb` file, where the default for `app_name` in a
  # Hanami app is `web`.

  # @since 0.1.0
  # @authenticated Irrelevant; normally called during framework setup.

  # Request a Password Reset Token
  #
  # Password Reset Tokens are useful for verifying that the person requesting a
  # Password Reset for an existing User is sufficiently likely to be the person
  # who Registered that User or, if not, that no compromise or other harm is
  # done.
  #
  # Typically, this is done by sending a link through email or other such medium
  # to the address previously associated with the User purportedly requesting
  # the Password Reset. `CryptIdent` *does not* automate generation or sending
  # of the email message. What it *does* provide is a method to generate a new
  # Password Reset Token to be embedded into an HTML anchor link within an email
  # that you construct.
  #
  # It also implements an expiry system, such that if the confirmation of the
  # Password Reset request is not completed within a configurable time, that the
  # token is no longer valid (and so cannot be later reused by unauthorised
  # persons).
  #
  # @since 0.1.0
  # @authenticated Must not be authenticated.
  # @param [String] user_name The name of the User for whom a Password Reset
  #                 Token is to be generated.
  # @return [Symbol, true] True on success or error identifier on failure.
  # @example
  #   def call(params)

  # in question *is not Authenticated* at the time of the action.

  #
  # If the new Clear-Text Password and its confirmation match, then the
  # value of that new Encrypted Password is returned, and the Repository record
  # for that Registered User is updated to include the new Encrypted Password.
