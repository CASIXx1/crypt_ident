# CryptIdent Version History

## 0.1.0 (18 December 2018)

Initial public (pre-)release.

"Why isn't this 1.0.0?", you ask. Because nobody, including me, has yet put code using `CryptIdent` into production (internal or otherwise). Therefore, any problems encountered in doing so can be resolved prior to an official 1.0.0 release. After 1.0.0, [semantic-versioning](https://semver.org/) rules apply.
